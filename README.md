# Overview
CGL is a software library designed to facilitate the use of genome annotations as substrates for computation and experimentation; we call it "CGL", an acronym for Comparitive Genomics Library, and pronounce it "Seagull". The purpose of CGL is to provide an informatics infrastructure for a laboratory, department, or research institute engaged in the large-scale analysis of genomes and their annotations.
